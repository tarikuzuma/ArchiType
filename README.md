Console-based application to convert units, find right triangle angles, etc. Made this for a defense, also my calculator sucked when I had no internet so I decided to make this application.


Version 1.0 is just the unupdated command-line interface


***This Version Includes:***
*  Pythagorean Theorem Calculator
*  Temperature Converter (F and C only)
*  Coming soon: Height Converter!


attached here is just the XML file of the flowchart as well.
