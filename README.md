Console-based application to convert units, find right triangle angles, etc.

Version 1.0 is just the unupdated command-line interface

attached here is just the XML file of the flowchart as well.

Made this for a defense, also my calculator sucked when I had no internet so I decided to make this application.

Upload and see the flowchart via:
app.diagrams.net
